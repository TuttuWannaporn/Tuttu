		<h1>THE ORIGIN OF THE LOLCAT MEME</h1>
		<p>the origin of the lolcat meme.  It turns out, the oldest known reference to an lolcat style picture/caption dates all the way back to 1903 from photographer Harry Whittier Frees, who would take photos of small animals, including cats, dressed up in various outfits.  These photos were then often sold in postcards by Rotograph, the company Frees worked for.  Captions were typically added, often by Frees himself, that said things like “How’s the weather out?” and “What’s delaying my dinner?” and “I can haz top hat?” (ok, I made that last one up).
			Another interesting example of “cats with captions” was in 1929 in an issue of “Parents Magazine”.  This picture (shown below), was originally marketed to be sold in nursery’s.
			Fast forward a little over 70 years later and we have 4chan.  The site that has spawned more memes than Steven Hawking has brain cells… so er ya, a lot.    Around 2005, they picked right up where Frees left off, but making a few tweaks; namely: less dressing cats up and more just random pics of cats; using “kitty pidgin” instead of proper English for the captions; and coining the name “lolcat” as early as June 2006.  4chan even had a dedicated day, “Caturdays”, where people would post these.
			Original LOLCat 1929 Nursery Cat Is Watching You Parent Gradually, thanks to 4chan, these pics were spread about the internet becoming popular on a variety of sites like fark, fazed, vwforums, gpforums, somethingawful, ebaumsworld, etc, but no central site dedicated to them was put up for quite some time.
