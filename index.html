					<h1>WHERE THE WORLD MEME COMES FROM</h1>
					<div class="container">
						<p>In its early days, “meme”, which incidentally is often mispronounced as “me-me” or “meh-meh”, but in fact should be pronounced <strong><span>“Meem”</span></strong>, primarily was only known and used by certain academics, but today this neologism is beginning to reach widespread use thanks to describing the viral spread of jokes, ideas, etc. via the internet.</p>

					<p>We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. <span class="band-color">‘Mimeme’</span> comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like ‘gene’. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to ‘memory’, or to the French word même. It should be pronounced to rhyme with ‘cream’.</p>

				<div class="container1">
				<p>The French word même that he references means “same” or “alike” (though the meaning changes somewhat depending on how it is used).  The Greek word “mimeme” he derives “meme” from comes from the Ancient Greek μίμημα (mīmēma), meaning “that which is imitated” / “something imitated” / “something copied”.
				<p>As stated, Dawkins was hoping that the word would be used as a unit of human cultural transmission, such as a melody, fashion, or catch-phrase, with the idea evolving as it spreads and time passes.</p>
				<p>This evolution is primarily spurred by the fact that people refine the memes or simply don’t “copy” the information exactly when they transmit it to another human.  This has since given rise to other derivative words or phrases including:</p>

						<li>Memetics & rdquo : which explores the transmission and evolution of cultural ideas in a scientific manner, though often somewhat unsuccessfully with the <dfn>“scientific”</dfn> part.</li>
						<li>Meme Complex or memeplex : memes that have evolved into a symbiotic relationship with other memes.  In terms of internet memes, this would be like the relationship between a meme such as “Herp/Derp” and various other meme elements that make up rage comics. In “real life” memes, this would be like the combined ideas that together form a certain religion.</li>
						<li>Memotype : the information-content of the meme.</li>
						<li>Memeoid : people who are so ingrained with some meme that they are willing to sacrifice themselves as a result of it, such as suicide bombers and the like. In a less extreme sense, it could be argued that every single person on the planet is a memeoid of one type or another.</li>
						<li>Memetic Marketing :  the use of memes to virally market some product or business, often using internet memes.</li>
